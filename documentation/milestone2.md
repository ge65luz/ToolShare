# :two: Milestone 2


##TaskRunner

I chose invoke as the task runner for this project. Invoke is a python library that allows you to run tasks in a python script. It is similar to makefiles but is written in python. It is a good choice for this project because it is easy to use and is written in python which is the language that I am using for this project.


##Asserstion Library

I chose pytest as the assertion library for this project. Pytest is a testing framework that makes it easy to write simple and scalable tests. It is a good choice for this project because it is easy to use and is written in python which is the language that I am using for this project.

##Web Framework

I chose FASTAPI as the web framework for this project. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is a good choice for this project because it is easy to use and is written in python which is the language that I am using for this project.
